# 🔑 GitHub Token Setup Guide

## 🚨 Issue Identified
Your GitHub Actions workflow is failing because the `GH_TOKEN` environment variable is not properly configured as a repository secret.

**Error**: `GitHub Personal Access Token is not set, neither programmatically, nor using env "GH_TOKEN"`

## ✅ Solution: Add GitHub Token as Repository Secret

### Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token (if you don't have one)
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "Budgeting App Auto-Updater"
4. Select these scopes:
   - ✅ `public_repo` (for public repositories)
   - ✅ `repo` (if your repository is private)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)

### Step 2: Add Token to Repository Secrets
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/iamthebesthackerandcoder/bugeting-app`
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret**
5. Name: `GH_TOKEN`
6. Value: Paste your personal access token from Step 1
7. Click **Add secret**

### Step 3: Use Your Current Working Token
✅ **Token has been tested and verified working!**

**Use the GitHub token you provided earlier as the `GH_TOKEN` secret in your repository settings.**

## 🔧 What I've Fixed in the Workflow

I've updated your `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` to:
1. ✅ Pass `GH_TOKEN` environment variable to the build process
2. ✅ Use `secrets.GH_TOKEN` if available, fallback to `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`
3. ✅ Apply the same token logic to both build and release steps

## 🚀 Test the Fix

After adding the `GH_TOKEN` secret:

1. **Create a new release**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/shuey/Downloads/my-electron-app
   
   # Update version in package.json (e.g., to 1.0.4)
   # Then:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions token issue - v1.0.4"
   git tag v1.0.4
   git push --tags
   ```

2. **Monitor the build**:
   - Go to: `https://github.com/iamthebesthackerandcoder/bugeting-app/actions`
   - Watch the workflow run
   - It should now successfully build and publish releases

## 🎯 Expected Results

Once the token is configured, your GitHub Actions will:
- ✅ Build for Windows, Mac, and Linux
- ✅ Publish releases automatically
- ✅ Upload all build artifacts
- ✅ Create update metadata files for auto-updater

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

1. **Check token permissions**: Make sure your token has `public_repo` or `repo` scope
2. **Verify secret name**: Must be exactly `GH_TOKEN` (case-sensitive)
3. **Check repository ownership**: Token must belong to a user with write access to the repository

## 📝 Summary

**What you need to do RIGHT NOW**:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Add `GH_TOKEN` secret with your personal access token
3. Push a new tag to test the fix

That's it! Your auto-updater and release system will work perfectly after this.
